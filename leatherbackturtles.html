                         <h3 class="h3">Characteristics</h3>
                         <p class="p1">The leatherback sea turtle is the largest of living turtles. Their body is streamlined, with large muscular shoulders. They have a secondary palate, 
                        formed by vomer and palatine bones. So the shell is not very distinct. The shell is leathery, oily and cartilaginous, and strengthened by a network of numerous tiny bones. It has no claws or scales. It has 7 pronounced ridges in its back & 5 on the underside. Their eyelids are thick and close to a vertical slit. The leatherback has a unique w-shaped mouth that is well adapted for grasping.</p>
                     <p class="p1">These turtles survive in waters that are very cold, which the other sea turtles cannot tolerate. 
                        They have a network of blood vessels that work as a counter-current heat exchanger. Also a thick insulating layer of oils and fats in their skin, 
                        are able to maintain body temperatures much higher than their surroundings. They also have a heat-exchange mechanism in their shoulder area, where cool blood from 
                        the flippers is warmed before it reaches the internal organs and shoulder muscles. They have an average lifespan (captivity) of 30 years. Leatherbacks are mostly 
                        solitary.</p>
