                  <p class="p">The loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta) is a fascinating sea turtle species that can be spotted in the coastal waters of Sri Lanka. 
                    Known for its distinctive large head and powerful jaws, it plays a significant role in the country's marine ecosystem. </p>
                    <br>
                    <h3 class="h3">Distribution</h3>
                    <p class="p1">They are found in south & south-east shore of Sri Lanka including Kosgoda & Rakawa. 
                    But they are also seen very rarely in Sri Lanka. This turtle is found in nearly all the world's temperate and tropical oceans: the Atlantic Ocean from Newfoundland to Argentina,
                     the Indian Ocean from southern Africa to the Arabian Gulf to Western Australia, the Mediterranean Sea,
                     and the Pacific Ocean from Alaska to Chile and Australia to Japan. During winter months loggerhead sea turtles migrate to tropical and subtropical waters</p>

                     <h3 class="h3">Characteristics</h3>
                    <p class="p1">These turtles are known for their large heads and strong, powerful jaws, which enable them to feed on a variety of prey, including crustaceans and mollusks. They have a reddish-brown carapace with a heart-shaped appearance, making them easily identifiable. Loggerheads are renowned for their incredible nesting habits, with females returning to the same beach where they were born to lay their eggs. Despite being listed as a vulnerable species, loggerhead turtles face threats such as habitat degradation, pollution, and accidental capture in fishing gear.
                         Conservation initiatives are crucial to ensure the survival of loggerhead turtles in Sri Lanka's coastal ecosystems.</p>
