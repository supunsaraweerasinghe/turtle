                  <p class="p">The green turtle (Chelonia mydas) is a majestic marine creature found along the coasts of Sri Lanka.
                     With its vibrant green body and gentle demeanor, it has become a symbol of the country's rich biodiversity.

                      <h3 class="h3">Distribution</h3>
                      <p class="p1">These turtles are known to nest in Akurella, Mawella, Kosgoda, Rekawa, Ambalantota, Yala & Bundala of Sri Lanka.
                         They are widely distributed in tropical & sub tropical regions especially around oceanic islands & along coasts with wide sandy beaches. 
                         Also they are seen in all oceans with primarily temperate waters. There is a huge population in Atlantic & Eastern Pacific oceans.</p>

                         <h3 class="h3">Characteristics</h3>
               <p class="p1"> These turtles are easily recognizable due to their large size and distinctive greenish-brown carapace. They have a serrated beak,
                             ideal for grazing on seagrasses and algae, making them herbivorous marine reptiles. Green turtles are known for their extensive migrations 
                             and can travel long distances between feeding and nesting grounds. They exhibit a unique homing instinct, returning to the exact beach where 
                             they were hatched to lay their eggs. Unfortunately, green turtles face numerous threats such as habitat destruction, poaching, and entanglement 
                             in fishing gear. Conservation efforts are vital in preserving their population and protecting their critical nesting sites along Sri Lanka's coastline.</p>
