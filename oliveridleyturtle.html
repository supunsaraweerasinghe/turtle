                    These turtles are known for their unique olive-colored shells and synchronized nesting behavior, known as arribadas.</p>

                    <h3 class="h3">Distribution</h3>

                      <h3 class="h3">Characteristics</h3>
                         <p class="p1"> These turtles exhibit a medium-sized body with a distinctive olive-colored carapace, which helps them blend in with their surroundings.
                             They have a strong, 
                            curved beak and powerful jaws, allowing them to feed on a variety of marine organisms. Olive ridleys are known for their synchronized nesting behavior, 
                            where thousands of females come ashore simultaneously to lay eggs. They are also highly migratory, traveling long distances across the ocean.
                             These turtles are resilient and adaptable, but their populations face threats from habitat degradation, pollution, and accidental entanglement in fishing gear. 
                             Conservation efforts play a crucial role in safeguarding the olive ridley turtles in Sri Lanka.</p>
